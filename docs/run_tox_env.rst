Tox template
============

The purpose of this template is to make it easy to map `tox
<https://tox.readthedocs.io/>`__ environments to Azure jobs. To use this
template, your repository will need to have a ``tox.ini`` file. Note that you
will also need to make sure you first load the templates as described in
:doc:`common`.

Basic setup
-----------

To use this template, you will need to add the following section to your
``azure-pipelines.yml`` file:

.. code:: yaml

    jobs:
    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        envs:
        - <os>: <tox env>
        - <os>: <tox env>

Where ``<os>`` is the operating system to test on, and ``<tox env>`` is the name
of a tox environment. The operating system should be one of ``linux``, ``linux32``,
``macos``, or ``windows``. An example might be:

.. code:: yaml

    jobs:
    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        envs:
        - linux: pep8
        - macos: py37-test
        - windows: py36-docs

In many cases, this may be enough, but there are additional options you can
specify, which we describe in the following sections.

Reporting coverage
------------------

To enable coverage reporting, add a parameter ``coverage`` that is set to the
name of the service to use:

.. code:: yaml

    jobs:

    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        coverage: codecov
        envs:
        - ...

At this time, only ``codecov`` is supported.

Test Type
---------

By default, To enable coverage reporting, add a parameter ``coverage`` that is set to the
name of the service to use:

.. code:: yaml

    jobs:

    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        coverage: codecov
        envs:
        - ...

At this time, only ``codecov`` is supported.


Non-Python dependencies
-----------------------

To make sure that non-Python dependencies are installed before the tox
environments are run, use the ``libraries`` parameter. This can have sections
for the ``apt``, ``yum``, ``brew`` (or ``brew-cask``), and ``choco`` tools which
are used for ``linux``, ``linux32``, ``macos``, and ``windows`` respectively,
and each of these sections should contain a list of package names to install
with these tools, e.g:

.. code:: yaml

    jobs:

    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        libraries:
          apt:
            - libopenjpeg5
          brew:
            - openjpeg
        envs:
        - ...

Note that as shown above, you don't need to specify all tools, only the ones for
which you need to install packages.

Pre-Tox Python dependencies
---------------------------

If you wish to install Python packages before tox is called, i.e. tox plugins,
you can pass the ``toxdeps`` parameter. These packages are installed at the same
time as tox itself.

.. code:: yaml

    jobs:

    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        toxdeps: tox-pypi-filter
        envs:
        - ...

Commandline Arguments to tox
----------------------------

If you wish to pass extra command line arguments to the tox command, you can
specify ``toxargs``.

.. code:: yaml

    jobs:

    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        envs:
        - linux: pep8
          toxargs: -i https://notpypi.org


X virtual framebuffer (Linux)
-----------------------------

If you want to make use of the X virtual framebuffer (Xvfb) which is typically needed
when testing packages that open graphical windows, you can set the ``xvfb`` parameter
to ``true``:

.. code:: yaml

    jobs:

    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        xvfb: true
        envs:
        - ...

This parameter only has an effect on Linux, and is ignored on other platforms.

Mesa OpenGL (Windows)
---------------------

If you need to use OpenGL on Windows, you should set the ``mesaopengl`` option
to install the Mesa OpenGL libraries:

.. code:: yaml

    jobs:

    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        mesaopengl: true
        envs:
        - ...

Conda
-----

If you want tox to be run with `tox-conda
<https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-conda>`_, include the string ``conda`` in your
tox environment name. This will automatically result in conda getting set up,
and tox-conda installed.

Positional arguments for tox
----------------------------

If you want to make use of the ``{posargs}`` functionality in your ``tox.ini``
file, you can specify positional arguments to pass to tox for each job using the
``posargs`` parameter:

.. code:: yaml

    jobs:
    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        envs:
        - linux: pep8
        - macos: py37-test
          posargs: -n=4
        - windows: py36-docs


Submodule Checkout
------------------

If you want to change the submodules setting to the `Checkout
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema#checkout>`__
task you can set the ``submodules`` parameter. For instance:


.. code:: yaml

    jobs:
    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        submodules: false
        envs:
        - linux: pep8


Setting or overriding options on a job by job basis
---------------------------------------------------

The ``coverage``, ``libraries``, ``posargs`` and ``xvfb`` parameters can be
specified on a job by job basis instead of or as well as globally, and take
precedence over global options:

.. code:: yaml

    jobs:
    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        coverage: codecov
        posargs: '-n=4'
        libraries:
          brew:
          - fftw
        envs:
        - linux: pep8
          coverage: false
          libraries: {}
          posargs: ''
        - macos: py37-test
        - linux: py36-test
          xvfb: true
        - windows: py36-docs
          libraries:
            choco:
              graphviz

In the above example, we have disabled coverage testing, posargs, and any
libraries for the ``pep8`` job, and overridden ``libraries`` so that ``graphviz``
gets installed on Windows.

Naming Jobs
-----------

Optionally you can name an env, which is useful if you want to refer to that job
later in your pipeline, e.g. in the publish template's ``dependsOn`` parameter.

.. code:: yaml

    jobs:
    - template: run-tox-env.yml@OpenAstronomy
      parameters:
        envs:
        - linux: py36-test
          name: py36_test


Note, that job names in Azure pipelines can only contain `A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and
underscore
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema#job>`__.
Which is why they are not automatically set from the tox env names, as they
frequently have hyphens in.

Linux 32-bit
------------

When testing on 32-bit linux (i.e. with the OS set to ``linux32``, note that the
Xvfb and conda options will not work. In addition, when using the ``libraries``
parameter, you should use ``yum`` rather than ``apt`` as the tool name.
